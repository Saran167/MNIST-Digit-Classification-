This project demonstrates the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits) is normalized to a range of [0, 1] to help the neural network train efficiently.

DATASET

MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) is a collection of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0â€“9).
The dataset is divided into:
60,000 training images: Used to train the machine learning model.
10,000 test images: Used to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.Each image is 28x28 pixels.
The dataset is labeled, meaning each image has a corresponding digit (0-9) as the ground truth.
